Bell Button Challenge
I built an interactive dashboard that displays information about different bacterial samples found in belly buttons. 
When a user selects a sample from a dropdown menu, the dashboard automatically updates to show three things which include:
A summary of the sampleâ€™s demographic data
A bar chart of the top 10 bacteria found in that sample
A bubble chart showing the full range of bacteria found in that sample
To make this work, I used JavaScript and the D3 library to load and filter data from a JSON file. Then, I used Plotly to create the interactive charts.
